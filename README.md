# Todo List

A to-do list project made to help me learn nodejs and various technologies (like: npm, handlebars, express etc) surrounding it.

## Functionality
The landing page provides you with 2 options, one to get add a task by typing out it's name and the other to remove a task by typing out it's index number shown.

## Expandabiliy
This can be expanded to include database management using technologies like MongoDB, SQL etc and to include a front-end to make the whole process pleasing to the eyes and ears.

## Input Validation
As an added restriction to help me learn validation, I have added a validator that checks if the inputted index lies within the array containing the task listing.

## Usability
Run the index.js and open the port number (default port no which is 3000).
